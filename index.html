                <p>Hello! I'm Carrie, a versatile professional with a diverse background in web development, instructional technology, and administration. With a recent education in full-stack development, I have gained hands-on experience in creating user-centered, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve user experiences, and I bring a detail-oriented approach to every project I undertake.</p>
                <p>Prior to my journey in web development, I spent over a decade in administrative roles within the healthcare and educational sectors. During this time, I developed strong skills in project management, team collaboration, and adaptabilityâ€”qualities that have enhanced my ability to work effectively in any environment. My experience includes everything from managing electronic health records to designing learning modules, which has given me a unique perspective on how technology can streamline processes and enhance learning.</p>
                <p>I am driven by continuous learning and am always eager to take on new challenges, whether it is leading a team project, learning a new programming language, or volunteering in my community. As I continue to grow in the field of web development, I look forward to combining my technical skills with my background in communication and problem-solving to create impactful digital experiences</p>

                    <h3>Culinary Critics Webpage</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">As the Scrum Master for this group project, I led the development of a full-stack application utilizing React with Vite, Bootstrap, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS, and Trello. Learning Trello from scratch, I successfully implemented it to manage the project timeline, organize tasks, and foster team collaboration. I also contributed by designing webpage mockups and component layouts in PowerPoint, developing a reusable `ReviewCard` component with multiple subcomponents, and applying UI/UX design principles to enhance the user experience. Additionally, I resolved CSS challenges to ensure consistent styling across the application.</p>

                    <h3>Oceans4All</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">Oceans 4 All was a project I created during my time in the Stiegler EdTech Full Stack Web Development apprenticeship. It marked an early milestone in my coding journey, where I designed my first Figma board to plan the layout and structure of the site. The project involved creating a non-profit website concept to promote free parking for beach access. I implemented a responsive, user-friendly interface using Bootstrap and developed web pages with HTML and CSS, focusing on improving user experience and accessibility. Additionally, I created custom contact cards and feature sections to highlight the website concept and functionality.</p>

                    <h3>School Management System</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">The School Management System was an individual project where I built a console-based Java application to efficiently manage information for schools, teachers, and students. I designed and implemented `School`, `Teacher`, and `Student` classes, encapsulating attributes and methods to manage teachers and students effectively. By applying object-oriented programming principles, I created modular and reusable code, showcasing core Java concepts such as class relationships and encapsulation. Additionally, I developed a main interface to facilitate user interactions with the system, ensuring a smooth and functional experience. This project deepened my understanding of Java and solidified my programming fundamentals.

                    <h3>Leadership Essentials for Nurses - Program Evaluation</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">As part of a collaborative graduate-level project for a real client, my team and I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of an online professional development course for nurse supervisors. We worked with the UNCW Swain Center to analyze course design, gather stakeholder feedback, and identify areas for improvement. Using data-driven methodologies, including survey analysis and adherence to instructional design frameworks, we provided actionable recommendations to enhance the course's effectiveness and learner satisfaction. This project emphasized teamwork, client communication, and applying evaluation models to real-world challenges.
