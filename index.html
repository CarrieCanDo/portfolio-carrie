			<blockquote>Hello! My name is Carrie Wright. I currently live in Eastern NC. I am a single parent and the proud mother of four wonderful children. I was the first in my family to go to college and thankfully my children followed in my footsteps.</blockquote>  
			<blockquote>I graduated in the spring of 2020 with a Master of Science in Instructional Technology. My past degrees include an Associates in Medical Office Administration and a Bachelors in Criminology.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Now that my children are grown and I have had time for myself again, I have found that I enjoy creating things; this website, online presentations, upcycling, etc. Growing up as a tomboy playing in the woods, I have always loved the beauty in nature. I enjoy going to the beach, hiking, and kayaking. </blockquote>
		<blockquote>My future goals are to finish my Certificate in Multimedia and Web Development, then maybe take some graphics or computer science classes. I would also like to take woodworking and oil painting.</blockquote>
