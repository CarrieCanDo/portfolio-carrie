                <p>Hello! I'm Carrie, a versatile professional with a diverse background in web development, instructional technology, and administration. With a recent education in full-stack development, I have gained hands-on experience in creating user-centered, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve user experiences, and I bring a detail-oriented approach to every project I undertake.</p>
                <p>Prior to my journey in web development, I spent over a decade in administrative roles within the healthcare and educational sectors. During this time, I developed strong skills in project management, team collaboration, and adaptabilityâ€”qualities that have enhanced my ability to work effectively in any environment. My experience includes everything from managing electronic health records to designing learning modules, which has given me a unique perspective on how technology can streamline processes and enhance learning.</p>
                <p>I am driven by continuous learning and am always eager to take on new challenges, whether it is leading a team project, learning a new programming language, or volunteering in my community. As I continue to grow in the field of web development, I look forward to combining my technical skills with my background in communication and problem-solving to create impactful digital experiences</p>

                    <h3>Culinary Critics Webpage</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">As the Scrum Master for this group project, I led the development of a full-stack application utilizing React with Vite, Bootstrap, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS, and Trello. Learning Trello from scratch, I successfully implemented it to manage the project timeline, organize tasks, and foster team collaboration. I also contributed by designing webpage mockups and component layouts in PowerPoint, developing a reusable `ReviewCard` component with multiple subcomponents, and applying UI/UX design principles to enhance the user experience. Additionally, I resolved CSS challenges to ensure consistent styling across the application.</p>

                    <h3>Oceans4All</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">Oceans 4 All was a project I created during my time in the Stiegler EdTech Full Stack Web Development apprenticeship. It marked an early milestone in my coding journey, where I designed my first Figma board to plan the layout and structure of the site. The project involved creating a non-profit website concept to promote free parking for beach access. I implemented a responsive, user-friendly interface using Bootstrap and developed web pages with HTML and CSS, focusing on improving user experience and accessibility. Additionally, I created custom contact cards and feature sections to highlight the website concept and functionality.</p>

                    <h3>School Management System</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">The School Management System was an individual project where I built a console-based Java application to efficiently manage information for schools, teachers, and students. I designed and implemented `School`, `Teacher`, and `Student` classes, encapsulating attributes and methods to manage teachers and students effectively. By applying object-oriented programming principles, I created modular and reusable code, showcasing core Java concepts such as class relationships and encapsulation. Additionally, I developed a main interface to facilitate user interactions with the system, ensuring a smooth and functional experience. This project deepened my understanding of Java and solidified my programming fundamentals.
